The second incarnation of my website in the Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.

Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

authentication, 
routing, 
sessions, 
queueing, 
and caching.
Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

I am using this wonderful framework to write a website for myself. This is the 4th or 5th incarnation of my website (I am not sure), and it is going to be the best one to date.

Official Documentation for Laravel

Documentation for the framework can be found on the Laravel website.
